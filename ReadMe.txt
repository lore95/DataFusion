KTH project to integrate ML video recognition and pressure boards, combining the extrapolated data in oder to generate an accurate 3d model of forces and movement of the human body.

Evaluating a patient's muscular power and movement fluidity is crucial in determining progress for post-surgery knee rehabilitation. Traditionally, physiotherapists rely on their experience and qualitative assessments, or, in some cases, utilize costly equipment in order to obtain reliable data for these evaluations. Our solution plans to offer a cheap, precise, universal and easily interpretable measurement of the required data through the use of force sensors and skeleton tracking.

The code in this repository is used to create a software that integrates readings from 4 force sensors and video-based skeleton tracking, to enhance and clarify the evaluation of a patient's post surgery knee recovery, beyond traditional methods.
