Project: ML Video Recognition & Pressure Boards for Post-Surgery Knee Rehabilitation @ KTH

INTRODUCTION
This project integrates machine learning-based video recognition and pressure boards to combine extrapolated data, generating an accurate 3D model of forces and human body movement. The main goal is to evaluate a patient's muscular power and movement fluidity, essential for monitoring progress in post-surgery knee rehabilitation.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Evaluating muscle power and movement fluidity is crucial for tracking post-surgery recovery in patients with knee injuries. Traditionally, physiotherapists rely on qualitative assessments or expensive equipment to obtain reliable data. This project aims to provide a cost-effective, accurate, and universal solution for precise measurements through force sensors and skeleton tracking technology.

SOLUTION
Our system leverages data from four force sensors on a Wii board combined with video-based skeleton tracking to offer enhanced evaluations of knee recovery. By providing precise metrics, it complements and improves traditional methods of physiotherapy, offering a more data-driven approach to post-surgery rehabilitation.

HOW IT WORKS
Force Sensors: Four force sensors from a Wii board collect data on pressure distribution during movement.
Skeleton Tracking: Video-based skeleton tracking technology captures the movement and alignment of the patient's body.
Data Integration: Both sources of data are combined to create a 3D model that visualizes forces and motion, allowing for detailed analysis of knee recovery progress.
