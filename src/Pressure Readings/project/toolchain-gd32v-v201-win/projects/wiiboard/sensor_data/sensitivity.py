"""
This programm calculates the sensitivity of a couple (sample rate, gain)

For that, we need to open a json file
we need to plot the recordings, select the range of samples we're interested in 
calculating the average unspecified value for a given weight
This unspecified value has to been stored in a json file with other values for other weights
By plotting we may observe a linear regression or not
If it is the case, we can plot the correlation number
Otherwise, we can find a more complex polynomial or try another couple (sample rate, gain)
